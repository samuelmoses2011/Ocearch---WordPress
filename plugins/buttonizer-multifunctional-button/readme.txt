= CHOOSE BETWEEN A NUMBER OF BUTTON CLICK ACTIONS =
Click to call, Whats'app chat, Back to top, Click to E-mail, Open URL & Open Javascript code, 


= CALL NOW: MAKE A FLOATING CALL BUTTON ONLY FOR MOBILE WITH BUTTONIZER =

Make it a lot more easier for your mobile website visitors to call you. With the Buttonizer you can easily make a floating call button for your mobile website. In just 2 minutes you can make your own click to call button.

= FLOATING MENU =

Create Dynamic Floating Menus. Choose the positioning of your menu, style your buttons, choose which actions (menu items) are shown on a set of rules (pages, desktop/mobile, opening hours etc.)

= STYLING OPTIONS & ICONS =

Next to choosing the color of your button, the color when someone click / hover over your button and the color of your icon, there is more. With the Buttonizer you can easily choose between font awesome icons but you can also add you own image / logo or icon. You can even add a moving icon in your button.

= SHOW ON DESKTOP, MOBILE OR BOTH =

Decide for each button if you want to show it on your desktop, mobile or both. Sometimes you want your visitors to do specific actions on your mobile website than your desktop and the other way around. For instance navigating to your address, or direct calling your business or share your content on Whats'app. Buttonizer lets you make an infinite number of combination of floating action buttons which are hidden on one clear simple button on the right corner of your screen.

= PAGE CATEGORIES (PAGE RULES) =

Of Course you can add a button for all your pages. But it is also possible to show a floating action button on specific pages. How? By easily adding a page category to the button. In a page category you can simply include or exclude the selected pages. This way you can add a specific floating call button selected pages and every page has its own conversion purpose. Create different rules like show on selected pages And wen pages contain 'Specific text'. 

= SHOW ON/AFTER OPENING HOURS =

Show a floating action button only when your business is open or closed. As an example: Add Facebook Messenger as a button and set it to show only on opening hours so your clients won't chat with your company outside opening hours. You can then add another button that is only shown after opening hours.

= AUTO EVENT TRACKING IN GOOGLE ANALYTICS =

Each button gets tracked on your website as long as your Google Analytics code is installed on your website. When you don&#39;t have it installed, or you have Google Tag Manager installed instead but still want to track your clicks on your floating action buttons? Than you can add you Google Analytics code manually in the setting tab of Buttonizer.

The best thing of all, the name you give to your button, is also seen in your Google analytics event page so you always know which buttons outperform the other.

= SOCIAL SHARING =

If you have a blog, share news articles, or have lucrative products that people want to share then you have to add social sharing buttons to your pages. The problem is, that most of the times you see a tremendous amount of social sharing buttons that distract your web visitors from interacting with your content. Why not have one clear button with all the sharing options possible when a visitor clicks on it. The Buttonizer lets you add social sharing button without filling your whole screen, without distracting your website visitors.

= LET YOUR BUTTONIZER SHOW ON THE BASIS OF YOUR WEB VISITORS BEHAVIOR =

You can decide if you want your Buttonizer to show after a specific amount of time that your visitor is on your website or when after a percentage amount of scroll on a page. For example, the scroll depth option can come in handy when you have a blog and you want to display social sharing options after your visitor has red a good part of your article. This way you ask the attention of your readers at just the right time.

It is also possible to add Exit Intent. The floating action button will show itself when a visitors tries to leave the website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Floating Action Button and why should I use it? =

A floating action button is a button that 'float' on the right corner of your website.

Maybe you noticed already that a lot of applications (mobile and web) have their primary floating action button (FAB), on the right corner of their website or app. You see this a lot with chat funtions. The Floating Action Button is becoming a standard in application and webdesign. Webvisitors are getting more and more used to the fact that there is a floating action button which is the primary action you can make on that page, on the right corner of a website.

The Buttonizer is a new way to give a boost to your number of interactions, actions and conversions from your website visitor by adding a Customizable Smart Multifunctional Floating Button in the corner of your website.

= What's the difference between floating action buttons or other conversion buttons? =

With Buttonizer you don't just add the same button to every page on your website. No, the key is that each action must be relevant. With the Buttonizer it&#39;s possible to add buttons to a select number of pages with "page rules", decide for each button if it shows on mobile and/or desktop, style your button with your own icons & colors, add social sharing buttons, Show the button on opening hours and make use of many more rules.

And the beauty of all: All actions are hidden in one button. The moment a visitor clicks on your Floating Action Button it will *pop* all specific buttons you&#39;ve set for that page. Track each single button in Google Analytics so you can see which actions your visitors prefer.

In fact the Buttonizer is an addiction to use. You&#39;re website visitors will interact as never before.
